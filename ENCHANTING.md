1) you need to crack enchanting
2) crack your player rng

for enchanting first place 15 bookshelf to achieve lvl 30 enchanting, then enable the temp-rule for enchanting by **/ctemprule set enchantingPrediction true**
now you can open enchanting table that you prepared early, nnow you can see that clientcommands are detecting current enchanting status, now by placing a dummy item like stone shovel and then pressing **Add Info** you can add current current enchanting status and start craching enchanting seed itself, now break bookshelf one by one and repeat this process, each time you brake one bookshelf and adding info the possible seed will reduce untile it's just showing one seed, 

after you found enchanting seed you have to crack your self rng,
for this just place 4 stack of any items on your hotbar and start process by **/ccrackrng** , if this command can find seed it will show something like this on chat: **Player RNG cracked: ``xxxxxxxxxxxx``** ,

if you can crack this 2 seed now you can use **/cenchant --simulate minecraft:netherite_chestplate with minecraft:protection 4 with minecraft:unbreaking 3**
